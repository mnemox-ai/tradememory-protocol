# TradeMemory Protocol

> Platform-agnostic 3-layer memory system for AI trading agents via MCP. Accepts standardized trade data from any source (MT5, Binance, Alpaca) and provides structured memory with LLM-powered reflection.

TradeMemory Protocol is an open-source memory layer for AI-assisted trading systems. It does NOT connect to trading platforms directly — it accepts standardized trade data and organizes it into three layers:

- L1 (Raw Trades): Every trade recorded automatically with full metadata
- L2 (Patterns): AI discovers what works and what doesn't across trade history
- L3 (Strategy): Memory becomes judgment — adaptive risk and strategy refinement

Key capabilities:
- 4 MCP tools: store_trade, recall_trades, get_performance, run_reflection
- LLM-powered reflection engine (Claude API) for trade analysis
- Adaptive risk management based on historical memory
- Platform-agnostic: works with MT5, Binance, Alpaca, or any trading platform
- MT5 auto-sync via mt5_sync.py (polls every 60 seconds)

## Documentation

- [README](https://github.com/mnemox-ai/tradememory-protocol#readme): Full documentation with architecture diagrams.
- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tradememory-protocol/): Install via `pip install tradememory-protocol`.
- [Quick Start](https://github.com/mnemox-ai/tradememory-protocol#quick-start): Multiple installation methods (MCP, source, Docker).

## MCP Tools

- store_trade: Record a trade with standardized schema (symbol, direction, lots, entry/exit price, PnL)
- recall_trades: Query trade history with filters (symbol, date range, strategy)
- get_performance: Calculate performance metrics (win rate, profit factor, drawdown)
- run_reflection: Trigger LLM-powered analysis of recent trades
